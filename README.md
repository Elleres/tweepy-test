# tweepy-test
This is my first project that I upload to github. Its just a test. It uses tweepy to reply to every tweet a account makes from the start of the program!

I created this bot to learn about tweepy and a little about twitter api. I endend up liking the end of it so I decided to post here.
You can use this however you want!
